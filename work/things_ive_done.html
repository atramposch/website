                During the fall of 2020 I occupied the position of <u>Associate Electrical Engineer</u> in the Systems
                Integration for Intelligent Transportation Systems (SIITS) Department
                supporting the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (better known in San Francisco as MUNI).
                Primarily this role focused on Train Control Engineering in support of the Automatic Train Control
                System that supports operation of light rail vehicles through the Market St. and Central Subway tunnels.
                Additionally, the team soon absorbed the Radio & Computer Aided Dispatch systems for both rail and
                rubber tire (bus) and focused on supporting those systems as part of the Technical Program umbrella.

                Starting in July 2014 I assumed the role of <u>Instrument & Electrical Engineer</u> at Chevron Richmond
                Refinery. I
                worked throughout the refinery in a variety of functions including supporting daily plant
                operation, plant outage/shutdown activities, emergency break-in work, and capital and expense projects.
                This role primarily focused on the instrumentation and electrical infrastructure in the refinery and the
                work assignments varied in complexity from simple instrument replacement to complete equipment control
                and/or electrical distribution
                overhaul. All projects led by me included managing project budget and timeline. The list below
                highlights
                some of the major projects I championed:

                        For 18 months between 2019 & 2020 I supported the event scoping, planning, & construction

                        I was the lead Instrument & Electrical engineer for this event. For this event I personally
                        completed/designed 7 construction packages of various complexity to be executed
                        during the event window.
                        In addition I was the lead engineer, project manager, and construction representative on a 10

                        various in plant loads during the event. This temporary power system utilized a permanent
                        12.47kV
                        plant power source instead of on-site diesel generation. This voltage was routed throughout the
                        plant and
                        stepped
                        down to 480V and 120V.
