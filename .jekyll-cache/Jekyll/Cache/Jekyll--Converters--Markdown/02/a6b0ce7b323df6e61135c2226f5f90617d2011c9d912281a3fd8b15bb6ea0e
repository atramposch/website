I"÷<p>Moving data from one place to another is one of the most important functions in todayâ€™s ever connected society. For years, programmers used simple text files or comma separated values to translate data from one program or computer to another. These were not necessarily â€œhuman-readableâ€ and if they were provided in binary format, youâ€™d need a specific program to view or edit. How do we translate data in a structured format that is â€œhuman-readableâ€ and potentially self-validating?</p>
