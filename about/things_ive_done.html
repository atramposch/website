<h2>Things I've Done</h2>
<p>This page is a showcase of professional work & personal projects, and a place to keep a record of those things. This
    is a living

                Starting in July 2014 I assumed the role of <u>Instrument & Electrical Engineer</u> at Chevron Richmond
                Refinery. I
                have worked throughout the refinery in a variety of functions including supporting daily plant
                operation, plant outage/shutdown activities, emergency break-in work, and capital and expense projects.
                This role primarily focused on the instrumentation and electrical infrastructure in the refinery and the
                work assignments varied in complexity from simple instrument replacement to complete equipment control
                overhaul. All projects led by me included manging project budget and timeline. The list below highlights
                some of the major projects I championed:
